// This file contains the list of suppressions used by the cppcheck tool
// <https://cppcheck.sourceforge.io/manual.pdf>
// The format for an error suppression is one of:
// [error id]:[filename]:[line]
// [error id]:[filename2]
// [error id]
// The error id is the id that you want to suppress.
// The filename may include the wildcard characters *or ?, which matches any
// sequence of characters or any single character respectively. It is recommended to
// use “/” as path separator on all operating systems. The filename must match the
// filename in the reported warning exactly.

// error ids
